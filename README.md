## Qualcomm Repolinter GitHub Action

Qualcomm repos should enable the Repolinter GitHub Action upon creation. This action runs the Repolinter tool, which lints open source repositories for common issues.

### Initial setup

1. Navigate to the new repo
1. Click on Actions
1. If you have existing actions in the repo, click "New workflow", else skip to next step
1. Locate the "By Qualcomm" section and click "Configure" under "Qualcomm Organization Repolinter Workflow"
1. Click "Commit changes...", select "Commit directly to the main branch" (or feel free to create a new branch and start a PR), ensure your Qualcomm email is selected under "Commit Email", and then click "Sign off and commit changes"
1. This will create a GitHub Action config file in your repo under the path `.github/workflows/qualcomm-organization-repolinter.yml`
1. Adjust it as needed, e.g. the Repolinter action is configured to run on Push and Pull Requests into the main/master branch, but you may want to further adjust when it runs.

### Customize Repolinter Rules

When the GitHub Action is run, it first checks your Qualcomm repo for a local `repolint.json` file at the root directory. If it doesn't find one it'll use the default Qualcomm Repolinter ruleset, which is located here https://github.com/qualcomm/.github/blob/main/repolint.json

To customize the default Qualcomm Repolinter ruleset (e.g. to add some language specific file extensions for the license check), you can extend the default ruleset and override specific rules. In other cases you may have to copy the ruleset locally and edit as needed. See below for examples.

#### Exclude directories or files from the source file header check

For example, if we wanted to exclude the copyright/license check for a directory e.g. `/test-data` from Repolinter, we can extend the ruleset as we are adding additional rules.

1. Create the file `repolint.json` at the root of your project
1. "Extend" the Qualcomm repolint.json file

```json
{
  "extends": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qualcomm/.github/main/repolint.json",
  "rules": {}
}
```

3. Copy the rule block you need to adjust from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qualcomm/.github/main/repolint.json`. E.g. in this case we want to exclude `/test-data` from the license header check. So let's copy the json block `source-license-headers-exist` and paste it into the `rules` section of the local `repolint.json` we extended
1. Now lets add the `test-data` directory to the list of patterns to skip/exclude from being checked

```json
{
  "extends": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qualcomm/.github/main/repolint.json",
  "rules": {
    "source-license-headers-exist": {
      "level": "error",
      "rule": {
        "type": "file-starts-with",
        "options": {
          "globsAll": [
            "**/*.py",
            "**/*.js",
            "**/*.c",
            "**/*.cc",
            "**/*.cpp",
            "**/*.h",
            "**/*.ts",
            "**/*.sh",
            "**/*.rs",
            "**/*.java",
            "**/*.go",
            "**/*.bbclass",
            "**/*.S"
          ],
          "skip-paths-matching": {
            "patterns": [
              "babel.config.js",
              "build\/",
              "jest.config.js",
              "node_modules\/",
              "types\/",
              "uthash.h",
              "test-data\/"
            ]
          },
          "lineCount": 60,
          "patterns": [
            "(Copyright|©).*Qualcomm Innovation Center, Inc|Qualcomm Technologies, Inc|Copyright (\\(c\\)|©) (20(1[2-9]|2[0-2])(-|,|\\s)*)+ The Linux Foundation",
            "SPDX-License-Identifier|Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without"
          ],
          "flags": "i"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Include only specific directories or files in the source file header check

For example, to only check `.c` files in a specific directory (e.g., `/src`) in the copyright/license check using Repolinter, we cannot extend and must instead replace the ruleset and edit it as necessary.

1. Copy the default Qualcomm [repolint.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qualcomm/.github/main/repolint.json) ruleset to the root of your project
2. Find the relevant rule to edit. In this example, we are going to edit the `source-license-headers-exist` rule and replace the `globsAll` property to only `.c` files in the `/src` directory.

```json
[...]
    "source-license-headers-exist": {
      "level": "error",
      "rule": {
        "type": "file-starts-with",
        "options": {
          "globsAll": [
            "src/**/*.c"
          ],
          "skip-paths-matching": {
            "patterns": []
          },
          "lineCount": 60,
          "patterns": [
            "(Copyright|©).*Qualcomm Innovation Center, Inc|Qualcomm Technologies, Inc|Copyright (\\(c\\)|©) (20(1[2-9]|2[0-2])(-|,|\\s)*)+ The Linux Foundation",
            "SPDX-License-Identifier|Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without"
          ],
          "flags": "i"
        }
      }
    },
[...]    
```
